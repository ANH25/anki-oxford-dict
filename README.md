An Anki add-on to get word definitions and pronunciations from the Oxford Dictionaries using the official [API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com).

The add-on mimics the [AutoDefine add-on](https://github.com/z1lc/AutoDefine).
It works by looking up the content of the currently focused field when activated
and populating other fields according to the config file.

See [config.md](config.md) for usage and options.
